[Verse: Playboi Carti & DJ Swamp Izzo]
First I go whip out the boat
No, I can't hit on no brakes
My life is out of control
I'm tellin' you, nobody safe
I've been livin' my life limbo
My ice, it came with a tray
It's so hot, I gotta hide my face
This not a rockstar phase
I'm a emo thug in my phase
Syrup, syrup, syrup, syrup, tell her to go chase
Monkey nuts, hold me, baby, I got on two chains
Roll another blunt and I might motherfuckin' faint
Spin on the block, have a pussy nigga stained
I just put on my boots, ain't worried 'bout no rain
Put a nigga down, Channel 2 front page
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed
Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, shit get strange
Fully loaded check, hold up, baby, Jordan paid
I put duct tape on my switch, perfect aim
They can't put me in no genre baby, 'cause I changed the game
We fuckin' on the same ho, but we not the same
Disrespect the 5, I put your ass in the food chain (Swamp Izzo)
Bitch keep callin' my phone, she sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain (Carti)
We was just outside dancin', movin' on molly, feelin' insane (He's comin')
I fucked the bitch so nasty, we go Sephora, yeah, then we go PINK
She not so fuckin' toxic, and she care about what I think
She's nothin' like no other bitches, she care about what I drink
I think she's a fling
I think she's a play maker
She should be on my team
She should get her a ring
Shit, it can't be me
But she can be on the team
Diamonds, they come out the water
My sock, it come with a ring
The Wraith came with the chauffeur
The chauffeur ready to take me
