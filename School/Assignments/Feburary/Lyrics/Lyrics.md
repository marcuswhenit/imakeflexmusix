#### [Verse: Playboi Carti & DJ Swamp Izzo] <br>
First I go whip out the boat <br>
No, I can't hit on no brakes <br>
My life is out of control <br>
I'm tellin' you, nobody safe <br>
I've been livin' my life limbo <br>
My ice, it came with a tray <br>
It's so hot, I gotta hide my face <br>
This not a rockstar phase <br>

I'm a emo thug in my phase <br>
Syrup, syrup, syrup, syrup, tell her to go chase <br>
Monkey nuts, hold me, baby, I got on two chains <br>
Roll another blunt and I might motherfuckin' faint <br>
Spin on the block, have a pussy nigga stained <br>
I just put on my boots, ain't worried 'bout no rain <br>
Put a nigga down, Channel 2 front page <br>
You was just askin' for some change, now you changed <br>

Yeah, I told you, yeah, about that money, shit get strange <br>
Fully loaded check, hold up, baby, Jordan paid <br> 
I put duct tape on my switch, perfect aim <br>
They can't put me in no genre baby, 'cause I changed the game <br>

We fuckin' on the same ho, but we not the same <br>
Disrespect the 5, I put your ass in the food chain (SWAMP IZZO!) <br>
Bitch keep callin' my phone, she sayin' Ms. Jackson goin' through her brain (CARTI!) <br>
We was just outside dancin', movin' on molly, feelin' insane (HE'S COMIN'!) <br>

I fucked the bitch so nasty, we go Sephora, yeah, then we go PINK <br>
She not so fuckin' toxic, and she care about what I think <br>
She's nothin' like no other bitches, she care about what I drink <br>
I think she's a fling <br>
I think she's a play maker <br>

She should be on my team <br>
She should get her a ring <br>
Shit, it can't be me <br>
But she can be on the team <br>
Diamonds, they come out the water <br>
My sock, it come with a ring <br>
The Wraith came with the Chauffeur <br>
The Chauffeur ready to take me <br>

#### [Outro: DJ Swamp Izzo] <br>
I AM THE MUSIC! <br>
